# ramdisk
interface to use, eventually for cross-platform setup and maintenance of ramdisk, primarily for unittesting and compiling code.

Initial work done only for the Mac platform.

###Mac

Instanciating the RamDisk class will create a ramdisk that you can use - in chunks of 1Mb.

Initial work done only for the Mac platform.

##Future work:

###Linux

Ramdisk class that can use either current method for creating a ramdisk on Linux

###Windows

Will call a currently available binary to create a ramdisk.

Future plans to duplicate in other languages as well.
